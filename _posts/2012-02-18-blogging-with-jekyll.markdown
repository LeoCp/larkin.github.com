title: Making a github page with Jekyll

### Fun with Jekyll
I spent the last few hours building the layout for this blog, which is hosted on github pages.  In the process, I brushed up on CSS and got a little lost with line height-- I wish I could explain why the navbar sub links align properly (they didn't initially).  


### What's next?
I need to get back to work on a secret project.  You can find me in the lab.
